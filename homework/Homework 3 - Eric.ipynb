    "# Mathematical duration is a theoretical measure of bond price sensitivity to interest rates, but the regression betas (level beta) are much smaller, showing that real-world price movements are less sensitive than duration predicts. This difference suggests that factors like convexity, market liquidity, and hedging impact actual bond price behavior. While duration is useful for quick estimates, regression betas provide a more accurate realistic view of interest rate risk."
